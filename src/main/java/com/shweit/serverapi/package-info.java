/**
 * This package contains the API endpoints for the server API.
 * <p>
 *     This package is responsible for defining the API endpoints for the server API. The API endpoints are defined as classes with methods that handle HTTP requests. The API endpoints are organized into different classes based on the type of operation they perform. The API endpoints are defined using the Javalin framework, which provides a simple and lightweight API for building web applications in Java.
 * </p>
 *     This package contains the following classes:
 *     The {@link com.shweit.serverapi.api.v1.endpoints.PlayerAPI} class contains endpoints for player-related operations.
 *     The {@link com.shweit.serverapi.api.v1.endpoints.WhitelistAPI} class contains endpoints for whitelist-related operations.
 *     The {@link com.shweit.serverapi.Routes} class contains the routes for the API.
 *     The {@link com.shweit.serverapi.api.v1.ApiV1Initializer} class initializes the API endpoints.
 *     The {@link com.shweit.serverapi.api.v1.models.Player} class represents a player.
 *     The {@link com.shweit.serverapi.api.v1.models.Whitelist} class represents a whitelist entry.
